Both classes load assemblies from your project.
You need to change the desired assembly (resource) build action to "Embedded Resource"
in the Visual Studio's properties editor.

-managed loader loads only net assemblies (.NET dlls)
-unmanaged loader copies all your files to the user's temp folder
and call them from there.
